<img src="https://s11.ax1x.com/2024/01/18/pFADG9I.png" alt="pFADG9I.png" style="zoom: 20%;" />

结果：The first layer is changing your outcome. --- losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship.

行动：The second layer is changing your process. --- developing a meditation practice

角色：The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. --- your worldview, your self-image

**Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe**



The Story

> Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs.
>
> The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.”It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who smokes.



**When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact.**

The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.

The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.

The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.



**THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY**

1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

 The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.
