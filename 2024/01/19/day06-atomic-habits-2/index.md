# day06 4 Simple Steps to Build Better Habits




**WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS**

A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.

There is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently



**THE HABIT LOOP**

1. cue-提示
2. craving-渴求
3. reward-反应
4. response-奖励



First, there is the **cue**. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior.

Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like **food, water, and sex**. 

Today, we spend most of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards like **money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction**.



Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit.



The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action

If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you won’t do it



Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of every habit.



​	Problem phase

1. Cue: You wake up.

2. Craving: You want to feel alert.

   

   Solution phase

3. Response: You drink a cup of coffee.

4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to feel alert. Drinking coffee becomes associated with waking up.
