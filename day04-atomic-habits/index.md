# day04 FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD


Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you.

The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-five degrees.

Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up.

Twenty-six degrees.

Twenty-seven.

Twenty-eight.

The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.

Twenty-nine degrees.

Thirty.

Thirty-one.

Still, nothing has happened.

Then, thirty-two degrees.

 The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift,seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change.

> This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last.

Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees.



What we should do?

**FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD**

Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

**专注于要做的事情**。
