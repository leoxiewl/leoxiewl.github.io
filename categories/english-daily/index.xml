&lt;li>财富 = 专注 + (stoicism自律 x 时间 x 多样化)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This is the first lesson in this book: economic security isn’t a function of what you earn but what you keep and knowing how much is enough for you.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>这本书的第一课，财富自由不是你能够赚多少钱而是你能够存多少钱并且知道有多少钱对你来说是足够的。&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>day09 The Best Way to Start a New Habit</title><link>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day09-atomic-habits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day09-atomic-habits/</guid><description>&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>implementation intention&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Implementation intention , which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>“When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>eg. Writing down the exact time to read books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the moment of action occurs, there is no need to make a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>day08 Be aware of your habits and actions, then point it</title><link>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day08-atomic-habits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day08-atomic-habits/</guid><description>&lt;p>With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.This is what makes habits useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions come under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind. You fall into old patterns before you realize what’s happening&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Always be aware of your bad habits. Before you engage in these habits, say out loud, &amp;lsquo;What am I about to do and what will be the consequences?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>day07 Chapter 3 Summary</title><link>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day07-atomic-habits-summary/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day07-atomic-habits-summary/</guid><description>&lt;p>A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>day07 Use four steps to design habits</title><link>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day07-atomic-habits/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day07-atomic-habits/</guid><description>&lt;p>we need to transform these four steps into a practical framework that we can use to design good habits and eliminate bad ones.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>THE HABIT LOOP&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;li>reward-反应&lt;/li>
&lt;li>response-奖励&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>First, there is the &lt;strong>cue&lt;/strong>. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>day06 Chapter 2 Summary</title><link>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day06-atomic-habits/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day06-atomic-habits/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change,and identity change.The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>day05 Chapter 1 Summary</title><link>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day05-atomic-habits/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day05-atomic-habits/</guid><description>&lt;p>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold.The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>day05 The most importantly, What is your identity.</title><link>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day05-atomic-habits-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day05-atomic-habits-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>THREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE

&lt;p>结果：The first layer is changing your outcome. &amp;mdash; losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>行动：The second layer is changing your process. &amp;mdash; developing a meditation practice&lt;/p>
&lt;p>角色：The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. &amp;mdash; your worldview, your self-image&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>day04 FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD</title><link>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day04-atomic-habits/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day04-atomic-habits/</guid><description>&lt;p>Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-five degrees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Twenty-six degrees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Twenty-seven.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Twenty-eight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Twenty-nine degrees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thirty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thirty-one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, nothing has happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, thirty-two degrees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift,seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>day03 Your future depends on what you do now</title><link>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day03-atomic-habits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leoxiewl.github.io/day03-atomic-habits/</guid><description>&lt;p>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.&lt;/p>
