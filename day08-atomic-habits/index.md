# day08 Be aware of your habits and actions, then point it




With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.This is what makes habits useful.

It’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions come under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind. You fall into old patterns before you realize what’s happening



**Solution**

**Always be aware of your bad habits. Before you engage in these habits, say out loud, 'What am I about to do and what will be the consequences?**



That’s the origin of the **Habits Scorecard**, which is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior. 

1. create your own, make a list of your daily habits.

Wake up

Turn off alarm

Check my phone

Go to the bathroom

Weigh myself

Take a shower

Brush my teeth

2. write “+”,  write “–” or write “=”

Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good habit, write “+” next to it. If it is a bad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”.

The marks you give to a particular habit will depend on your situation and your goals.

**There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is,effective at solving problems**

> Smoking a cigarette may reduce stress right now (that’s how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy long-term behavior.

3. Ask yourself questions.

Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?”
