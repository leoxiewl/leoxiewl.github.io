1. **implementation intention**

Implementation intention , which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act.

Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is:

**“When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”**

 eg. Writing down the exact time to read books.

When the moment of action occurs, there is no need to make a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan.

The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence:

**I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].**

If you aren’t sure when to start your habit, try the first day of the week,month, or year
